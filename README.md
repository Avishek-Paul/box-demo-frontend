# Box Demo Frontend

A small react project that allows users access a portal and upload documents into a Box folder as if they were applying for a loan.

Loan officers or administrators can then access the same portal (via an admin URL) to view the uploaded documents.

Created using create-react-app. Styling done primarily with Chakra-ui.
